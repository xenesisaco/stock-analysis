# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to easily summarize the 12 different stocks available (Under A - Column) with each individuals stocks’ yearly volume (Under B – Column), and the yearly closing price percentage (Under C – Column). These three key markers can give Steve’s family a better idea of what stocks to invest in.
The purpose of this classroom project however, is to increase efficiency and reduce the time to run the code.


#### Data
Total Daily Volume
Under Steve’s family view, the more a stock is traded, the better performance it will have. By summing up each stocks daily trading amount and filtering it by year, Steve can see the amount of yearly activity the stock is moving. 
#### Return 
A good indicator of a healthy stock is seeing an increase in stock price at the end of the year. By subtracting each individual stocks’ earliest closing price by year and the last closing price, Steve will be able to view which stocks have increased in price and which have decreased (in percentage).

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The script from the original file and the challenge were almost identical except that the new file has a few changes, which were easily transferrable. 
Running the code however, things seemed to go much smoother with the challenge VBA script is about  .1 sec faster than the original script.















## Summary: 
The main advantage to using refactoring code is the time efficiency and organization of the code. Which is helpful for finding errors and debugging. It can also allow others to read your code much more easily. However, if the code is large, complex and with many moving parts, refactoring may not be the most practical solution, especially if there is already pre-existing code.  



## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
1.	I did experience a better time efficiency after refactoring, even if it was only .1 sec better. I believe from the original code, it was easier to read as well, as seen below:
